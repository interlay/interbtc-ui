## About

The InterBTC UI connects the Polkadot ecosystem with Bitcoin. It allows the creation of InterBTC, a fungible token that represents Bitcoin in the Polkadot ecosystem. InterBTC is backed by Bitcoin 1:1 and allows redeeming of the equivalent amount of Bitcoins by relying on a collateralized third-party.
In comparison to other bridge constructions (like tBTC, wBTC, or RenVM) _anyone_ can become an intermediary by depositing collateral making InterBTC the only truly open system.

The bridge itself follows the detailed specification: <a href="https://interlay.gitlab.io/interbtc-spec/" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the specification »</strong></a>

It is implemented as a collection of open-source Substrate modules using Rust: <a href="https://gitlab.com/interlay/btc-parachain" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the implementation »</strong></a>

### Built with

-   [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
-   [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
-   [polkadot-js](https://polkadot.js.org/)
-   [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
-   [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


You can visit [rococo.interbtc.io](https://rococo.interbtc.io/) for the latest stable version of the website.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed locally.

You can run the UI with a local instance of the BTC-Parachain and in combination with [Bitcoin regtest](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode) or [Bitcoin testnet](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#testnet) as follows:

Clone this repository and enter into the root folder.

```bash
git@gitlab.com:interlay/interbtc-ui.git
cd interbtc-ui
```

Please make use of the `.env.*` files to set build variables. The priority of these are [defined here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#what-other-env-files-can-be-used).

### Regtest

> Note: By default use, regtest for local development.

In one terminal, start the BTC-Parachain, Bitcoin regtest, vaults and relayers:

```bash
yarn compose:regtest
```

On another terminal, start the UI:

```bash
yarn install && REACT_APP_BITCOIN_NETWORK=regtest yarn start
```

### Testnet

In one terminal, start the BTC-Parachain, Bitcoin regtest, vaults and relayers:

```bash
yarn compose:testnet
```

On another terminal, start the UI:

```bash
yarn install && REACT_APP_BITCOIN_NETWORK=testnet yarn start
```

## Detailed Starting Guide

> Note: The detailed starting guide requires you to have a Rust installation and requires you to build all the dependencies manually. This will take about two hours if you are doing this the first time. For most people, the docker-compose setup in the Quickstart guide above is recommended.

If you wish to run the BTC-Parachain, its clients and Bitcoin without using docker, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

**BTC Parachain**

You need to have an instance of the BTC Parachain running. Follow the instructions at the [BTC-Parachain repository](https://gitlab.com/interlay/btc-parachain). Once you have successfully build the BTC Parachain, start a development server from the root folder of the BTC Parachain repository.

```bash
./target/release/btc-parachain --dev
```

If you want to reset the development chain, execute the following command.

```bash
./target/release/btc-parachain purge-chain --dev
```

**Clients**

In order to automatically submit block headers, run the [staked-relayer](https://gitlab.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/-/tree/dev/staked-relayer) client software.

```shell
staked-relayer --keyring=eve --polka-btc-url 'ws://localhost:9944'
```

The architecture also relies upon collateralized vaults; use the [vault](https://gitlab.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/-/tree/dev/vault) client to register automatically.

```shell
vault --keyring=charlie --network=testnet --auto-register-with-collateral 100000000 --polka-btc-url 'ws://localhost:9944'
```

Issue requests (BTC -> InterBTC) can be executed solely through the UI but a vault client is required to redeem (InterBTC -> BTC).

Lastly, we require a price oracle to compute the exchange rate (BTC <> DOT), the [oracle](https://gitlab.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/-/tree/dev/oracle) client can automatically feed this from an integrated data source (e.g. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot/btc)).

```shell
oracle --keyring=bob --polka-btc-url 'ws://localhost:9944' --coingecko
```

### Regtest

**Bitcoin**

Download and start [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/).

```shell
bitcoind -regtest -server
```

**Electrs**

We make heavy use of the [Blockstream API](https://github.com/interlay/electrs) in the UI to watch for payments made on Bitcoin.

```shell
electrs -vvvv --network regtest --jsonrpc-import --cors "*" --cookie "rpcuser:rpcpassword" --daemon-rpc-addr localhost:18443 --http-addr "[::0]:3002" --index-unspendables
```

Start the app with:

```shell
yarn install
REACT_APP_BITCOIN_NETWORK=regtest yarn start
```

### Testnet

To run against Bitcoin testnet first start your daemon:

```shell
bitcoind -testnet -server
```

Start the app with:

```shell
yarn install
REACT_APP_BITCOIN_NETWORK=testnet yarn start
```

> Note: This is only supported on Linux due to issues with `network_mode: "host"` on Mac.

### Docker Installation

Clone this repository and enter into the root folder.

```bash
git@gitlab.com:interlay/interbtc-ui.git
cd interbtc-ui
```

Install the required dependencies.

```bash
docker build -t interbtc:ui .
```

Start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 interbtc:ui
```

### Test

Test the project.

```bash
yarn test
```

### Design System

Visualize the Tailwindcss configuration.

```bash
yarn tailwind-config-viewer
```

Locally Run or build Storybook.

```bash
yarn storybook # locally run
yarn build-storybook # build
```

## Help

### Bitcoin Regtest

Regtest is a local Bitcoin instance that allows you to practically anything including sending transactions, mining blocks, and generating new addresses.
For a full overview, [head over to the Bitcoin developer documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode).

**Sending Transactions**

For the issue process, you need to send a transaction. On regtest this can be achieved with:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice sendtoaddress VAULT_ADDRESS AMOUNT
```
**Mining Blocks**

In regtest, blocks are not automatically produced. After you sent a transaction, you need to mine e.g. 1 block:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress)
```

**Getting Balances**

You can query the balance of your wallet like so:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice getbalance
```

### Test Data (Regtest)

For more advanced interactions with the UI, you may also use the `testdata-gen` toolkit to automated some common actions.

For an overview of actions [check the documentation here](https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-clients/tree/master/testdata-gen#detailed-options).

**Installation**

> Note: This requires a local Rust installation.

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:interlay/interbtc-clients.git
cd interbtc-clients
cargo build -p testdata-gen
# environment variables for bitcoind
source .env
```

**Registering a New Vault**

For example, to register `bob` as a vault we can use the following command:

```shell
testdata-gen --keyring bob register-vault --btc-address "bcrt1qu0a2tc422uurm39g4p2n5wfpy65fwypnz7p9aw" --collateral 100000000
```

**Issue InterBTC**

Then when `alice` wants to issue 0.001 InterBTC, we need to send the equivalent number of Satoshis to `bob`:

```shell
testdata-gen --keyring alice send-bitcoin --btc-address "bcrt1qu0a2tc422uurm39g4p2n5wfpy65fwypnz7p9aw" --satoshis 100000
```

**More Options**

Print all the available options with:

```shell
testdata-gen --help
```

### Docker

You can hard-reset the docker dependency setup with the following commands:

```shell
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
