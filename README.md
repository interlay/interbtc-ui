## About

The Interlay UI connects the Polkadot ecosystem with Bitcoin. It allows the creation of interBTC and kBTC, a fungible token that represents Bitcoin in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. interBTC and kBTC are backed by Bitcoin 1:1 and allow redeeming of the equivalent amount of Bitcoins by relying on a collateralized third-party called Vaults.
In comparison to other bridge constructions (like tBTC, wBTC, or RenVM) _anyone_ can become an intermediary by depositing collateral making interBTC and kBTC the only truly open system.

The bridge itself follows the detailed specification: <a href="https://spec.interlay.io" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the specification »</strong></a>

It is implemented as a collection of open-source Substrate modules using Rust: <a href="https://gitlab.com/interlay/interbtc" target="_blank"><strong>Explore the implementation »</strong></a>

### Built with

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [polkadot-js](https://polkadot.js.org/)
- [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Kintsugi

You can visit the Kintsugi application at [kintsugi.interlay.io](https://kintsugi.interlay.io).

### Testnet

You can visit [bridge.interlay.io](https://bridge.interlay.io/) for the latest testnet.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed locally.

You can run the UI with a local instance of the Interlay or Kintsugi parachain and in combination with [Bitcoin regtest](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode) or [Bitcoin testnet](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#testnet) as follows:

Clone this repository and enter into the root folder.

```bash
git@gitlab.com:interlay/interbtc-ui.git
cd interbtc-ui
```

You can configure the application to use certain networks like the official test network as well as a local environment.
Please make use of the `.env.*` files to set build variables. The priority of these are [defined here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#what-other-env-files-can-be-used).

### Local Development

To achieve this, create a file `.env.development.local` and fill it with the following contents for either the Interlay or Kintsugi network versions:

#### Interlay Network

```bash
REACT_APP_RELAY_CHAIN_NAME="polkadot"
DOCKER_RELAY_CHAIN_CURRENCY=DOT
```

#### Kintsugi Network

```bash
REACT_APP_RELAY_CHAIN_NAME="kusama"
DOCKER_RELAY_CHAIN_CURRENCY=KSM
```

#### Starting the UI Locally

> Note: By default, use regtest for local development.

In one terminal, start the bridge, Bitcoin regtest, Vaults and oracles:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.development.local up
```

On another terminal, start the UI:

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

### Alternative Local Development Setup

From this repo, run:

```
rm -rf node_modules
docker-compose down -v
yarn install
docker-compose --env-file .env.regtest up
```

In another terminal, with the docker-compose services running, in the latest master branch from the lib (https://github.com/interlay/interbtc-api/) run: `yarn install && USER_1_URI="//Charlie" yarn initialize`

Then start the UI in another terminal:

```
set -a
source .env.regtest
yarn start-regtest
```

### Connecting to the Interlay Development Environment

> Note: This environment might be unstable. It uses the Bitcoin testnet work.

Copy the content of the `.env.dev` file to `.env.development.local`.

```bash
cp .env.dev .env.development.local
```

Start the UI:

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

### Connecting to the Interlay Testnetwork

> Note: This environment might be unstable. It uses the Bitcoin testnet work.

Copy the content of the `.env.testnet` file to `.env.development.local`.

```bash
cp .env.testnet .env.development.local
```

Start the UI:

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

### Test

Test the project.

```bash
yarn test
```

### Design System

Visualize the Tailwindcss configuration.

```bash
yarn tailwind-config-viewer
```

Locally run or build Storybook.

```bash
yarn storybook # locally run
yarn build-storybook # build
```

## Help

### Bitcoin Regtest

Regtest is a local Bitcoin instance that allows you to practically anything including sending transactions, mining blocks, and generating new addresses.
For a full overview, [head over to the Bitcoin developer documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/examples/testing.html#regtest-mode).

**Sending Transactions**

For the issue process, you need to send a transaction. On regtest this can be achieved with:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice sendtoaddress VAULT_ADDRESS AMOUNT
```

**Mining Blocks**

In regtest, blocks are not automatically produced. After you sent a transaction, you need to mine e.g. 1 block:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress)
```

**Getting Balances**

You can query the balance of your wallet like so:

```shell
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=Alice getbalance
```

### Docker

You can hard-reset the docker dependency setup with the following commands:

```shell
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
